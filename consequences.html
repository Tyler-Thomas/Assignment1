        <p> Effects of climate changed includes loss of sea ice, accelerated sea 
            level rise and longer, and more intense heat waves.</p>

    <div>
        <p> Temperatures Will Continue to Rise: <br> Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, 
            the temperature rise has not been, 
            <br> and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.

        <p>Earth's Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense : <br> The intensity, 
           frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the 
           strongest <br>(Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. 
           The relative contributions of human and <br>natural causes to these increases are still 
           uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates <br> are projected
           to increase as the climate continues to warm.

<h1>The Effects of Climate Change</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier"> Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring : <br> loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.<br> Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide</p>
<p style="font-family:courier"> Temperatures Will Continue to Rise: <br> Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, <br> and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.</p>

<p style="font-family: courier"> Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense : <br> The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest <br>(Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. <br>Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.</p>
